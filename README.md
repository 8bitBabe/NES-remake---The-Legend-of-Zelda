# NES-remake---The-Legend-of-Zelda
A shot at remaking the 1986 NES classic The Legend of Zelda in Unreal Engine 4.19 in all its 2D splendor. Runs in Andoid.

Project made for a Mobile Applications class in Atlantic University College.
The goal was to remake a retro game in Unreal Engine trying to emulate the mechanics of the original as closely as possible.
Everything art was taken from the original 1986 classic The Legend of Zelda except the Princess who was drawn and animated by myself.
The sounds were taken by FreeSounds.com 
Everything in terms of mechanics, widgets, map making and otherwise not stated before this sentence was made by myself.
